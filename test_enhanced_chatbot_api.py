## üåü NEW NATURAL LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES

### Weather Queries (All these work now!)
- "weather in 390001"
- "how is the weather today 390001"
- "what's the weather like in my area 390001"
- "390001 weather conditions"

### Crop Recommendations
- "what crop should i grow with 90 42 43 6.5 120"
- "recommend crop for my soil 90 42 43 6.5 120"
- "best crop for nitrogen 90 phosphorus 42 potassium 43"

### Fertilizer Advice
- "fertilizer for wheat"
- "what fertilizer should i use for wheat"
- "wheat fertilizer recommendations"
- "how to fertilize wheat crop"

### Market Prices
- "rice market prices"
- "how much does rice cost"
- "what is the price of rice today"
- "rice price in market"

### General Farming Questions
- "my plants have disease"
- "irrigation help needed"
- "soil testing advice"
- "pest control methods"
- "organic farming tips"

### Greetings & Help
- "hi good morning"
- "hello how are you"
- "namaste"
- "help me with farming"
- "what can you do"

## ‚ö° Traditional Commands (Still Work!)
- !help
- !weather 390001
- !crop 90 42 43 6.5 120
- !fertilizer wheat
- !market rice

## üß™ TESTING STEPS

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```
   python backend/run_server.py
   ```

2. **Send Test Messages via WhatsApp API**
   Use the webhook endpoint: `/api/whatsapp/webhook`

3. **Expected Behavior**
   - Natural language understood ‚úÖ
   - Context-aware responses ‚úÖ
   - Helpful suggestions ‚úÖ
   - Multilingual support ‚úÖ

## üöÄ LIVE TESTING

To test with real WhatsApp messages:

1. **Setup Webhook URL** (using ngrok)
   ```
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

2. **Configure Facebook Webhook**
   - URL: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/whatsapp/webhook
   - Verify Token: smartcrop_webhook_verify_2025

3. **Send Messages to Bot**
   - Farmers can now chat naturally!
   - No need to remember exact commands!

## üì± FARMER EXPERIENCE

**Before (Only commands):**
- Farmer: "!weather 390001"

**Now (Natural language):**
- Farmer: "how is the weather today in my area 390001"
- Farmer: "what fertilizer for my wheat crop"
- Farmer: "rice prices in market today"

üéâ **Much more user-friendly for farmers!**
